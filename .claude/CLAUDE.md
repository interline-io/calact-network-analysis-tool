# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CALACT Network Analysis Tool — a Nuxt 4 (Vue 3) SPA for browsing, analyzing, and visualizing transit networks across California, Oregon, and Washington. Built for CALACT and partner agencies (ODOT, WSDOT). Users query transit data (stops, routes, schedules, flex services) through a geographic interface with filtering, analysis, and reporting. Uses TypeScript with strict mode and strict Vue templates.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Dev server at localhost:3000
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm start        # Launch production server
pnpm lint         # ESLint (flat config)
pnpm test         # Vitest with coverage (single run)
pnpm test:watch   # Vitest in watch mode
pnpm check        # Lint (with --fix) + typecheck
pnpm calact       # Run CLI tool (tsx src/cli/calact.ts)
```

To use local copies of dependencies: run `pnpm link ../catenary` or `pnpm link ../tlv2-apps/packages/tlv2-auth` here.

## Architecture

### Framework & Config
- **Nuxt 4** with SSR disabled (`ssr: false`) — runs as an SPA
- **TypeScript strict mode** with `strictTemplates: true` for Vue template prop checking
- **Bulma CSS** via SCSS (`app/assets/main.scss`)
- **Node.js v20** (see `.nvmrc`)
- **Auth0** login gate with role `tl_calact_nat` required for access

### Key Dependencies
- **`@interline-io/catenary`** — Vue 3 UI component library (Bulma-based): buttons, forms, modals, tables, notifications, etc. Registered globally via plugin with `Cat` prefix.
- **`@interline-io/tlv2-auth`** — Nuxt 4 module providing Auth0 server-side sessions, CSRF protection, and API proxy (`/api/proxy/{backend}/...`). Provides `useUser()`, `useLogin()`, `useLogout()`, `useApiEndpoint()` composables.

### Data Flow
- **Transitland GraphQL API** is the primary data source, accessed through tlv2-auth's proxy system
- Frontend sends scenario parameters (bbox, date range, filters) to **server API routes** (`server/api/`)
- Server routes invoke core logic in `src/scenario/` and `src/analysis/` to fetch and process data
- Results stream back to the client as **NDJSON** (newline-delimited JSON) via `ReadableStream`
- Frontend renders results on MapLibre GL maps and data grids with filtering, export (CSV/GeoJSON), and reporting

### Directory Structure
- `app/pages/` — File-based routes: `index.vue` (home), `tne.vue` (Transit Network Explorer — the main app), `help.vue`, `admin/profile.vue`
- `app/components/cal/` — Main UI: query builder, map, data grid, filtering, reports, CSV/GeoJSON download, map sharing
- `app/components/analysis/` — Analysis-specific views: WSDOT service levels, WSDOT stops/routes, VisionEval
- `app/composables/` — `useAnalysisResults`, `useFlexAreaFormatting`, `useDebugMenu`, `useToastNotification`
- `app/layouts/` — `default` (sidebar + login-gated content area)
- `src/core/` — Shared utilities: GraphQL client, date/time helpers, geometry, streaming, constants, colors, task queue
- `src/tl/` — Transitland API integration: stops, routes, departures, agencies, feed versions, census geographies, GTFS-Flex
- `src/scenario/` — Scenario data fetching, filtering (by agency, route type, date, time), route headway/frequency calculations
- `src/analysis/` — Analysis modules: `wsdot/` (service levels 1–6), `wsdot-stops-routes/`, `visioneval/`, `ntd/`
- `src/cli/` — CLI entry points for running scenarios and analyses outside the browser
- `server/api/` — Nitro endpoints: `scenario.post.ts`, `wsdot.post.ts`, `visioneval.post.ts`, `examples.get.ts`
- `testdata/` — Test fixtures (GTFS feeds, WSDOT scenario data)
- `public/examples/` — Canned example queries

### Analysis Types
- **Scenario (Browse)**: Explore stops, routes, and schedules within a bounding box and date range
- **WSDOT Service Levels**: Classify routes by service quality (Level 1–6 + night service)
- **WSDOT Stops & Routes**: Detailed stop/route availability analysis
- **VisionEval**: Future scenario planning integration
- **NTD**: National Transit Database reporting

### Key Domain Concepts
- **Scenario**: A query combining geographic bounds (bbox), date range, and configuration (fixed-route/flex toggles, aggregation layer)
- **GTFS-Flex**: Demand-responsive transit support with pickup/dropoff area types and advance notice categories
- **Canned bounding boxes**: Predefined geographic areas (Portland, Seattle, Bend, Eugene, Salem, WA, OR) in `src/core/constants.ts`
- **Census geography integration**: Tract/blockgroup overlays for demographic analysis

## Verifying Changes

After making edits, run `pnpm check` to verify correctness (lint with auto-fix + typecheck). **Always run this before presenting work as done or ready for testing** — never skip the typecheck step.

## Git & PRs

Never create a PR or merge a PR automatically. Opening and merging PRs is always a 100% manual action by the repo owner. You may prepare branches, commits, and PR descriptions (see "PR Summary" below), but stop short of `gh pr create` or `gh pr merge` unless explicitly instructed in the current turn.

## Working from GitHub issues

Critical information from collaborators is often in the issue follow-up comments, not only the original description. When asked to work on an issue, always read the full comment thread — including wireframes, design mockups, attached images, clarifications, and user feedback — and consider them alongside the original description. Use `gh issue view <num> --comments` and fetch any image attachments (e.g. `curl` the `github.com/user-attachments/...` URLs) so you can view them before planning or implementing.

## Code Conventions
- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`
- 2-space indentation, LF line endings
- ESLint rules inlined in `eslint.config.ts` (stylistic and TypeScript rules)
- Always use braces `{}` for `if`/`for`/`while` blocks — never single-line returns without braces
- Tests use `filename.test.ts` pattern alongside source files in `src/`
- Package manager: pnpm (v10.x)
- CSS class names on our own components are prefixed with `cal-` (e.g. `cal-map-sidebar`, `cal-census-details-header`). Do not introduce unprefixed class names for component-internal styling — they can collide with Bulma, Catenary, or other libraries.

## Geometry operations: server-side only

Avoid client-side geometry operations (union, buffer, intersection, difference, area, etc.) — including via turf.js or any other JS geometry library. These libraries are not production-grade and cannot be trusted to agree closely with the calculations done in PostGIS on the backend. Always perform geometric work server-side via the Transitland GraphQL API (e.g. `stop_buffer`, `intersection_area`, `intersection_geometry`) and consume the results on the client. If a feature appears to require client-side geometry, treat that as a signal to extend the backend or adjust the design — not to introduce client-side geometric math.

**Exception:** computing a bounding box around features client-side (min/max of coordinates, e.g. `@turf/bbox` or hand-rolled) is fine — it's arithmetic, not a geometric calculation, and the result only needs to be approximate (e.g. for padding a query area or framing a map view). The ban is on operations whose correctness depends on agreeing with PostGIS.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example`. Key variables:
- `TRANSITLAND_API_BASE` — GraphQL API endpoint (used by CLI)
- `NUXT_TLV2_PROXY_BASE_DEFAULT` — API proxy base URL
- `NUXT_PUBLIC_TLV2_PROTOMAPS_APIKEY` — Map tiles API key
- `NUXT_PUBLIC_TLV2_LOGIN_GATE` / `NUXT_PUBLIC_TLV2_REQUIRE_LOGIN` — Set to `true` to test production auth behavior

## PR Summary

When asked to "generate PR summary", run `git diff main...HEAD` and `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to analyze all changes on the current branch, then output a GitHub-flavored markdown PR description wrapped in a fenced code block so it can be copy-pasted. No emojis, no checklists. Use this structure:

```
## Summary
<high-level one paragraph description of the PR>

## User-facing changes
<high-level description of changes to user interface, less focused on code details>
